## TheChecklist Logo Integration

The logo has been uploaded and needs to be saved as:
`src/images/theChecklist.png`

The Logo component has been updated to use this image file with Next.js Image component.

### Current Implementation:
- Logomark: 40x40px circular logo with deep indigo C and location pins
- Full Logo: Logo image + "TheChecklist" text in ClashGrotesk
- Used in: Header navigation and Footer

### File Location:
Place the uploaded logo image at: `src/images/theChecklist.png`

The component will automatically pick it up once the file is in place.
