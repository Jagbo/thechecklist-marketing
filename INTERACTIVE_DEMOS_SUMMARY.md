## Design System Adherence

All components follow the UI Style Guide from `/The-checklist/UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md`:

**Colors**:
- Primary: `#373854` (Deep indigo)
- Secondary: `#5b5c71` (Slate grey)

- Text: `#1a1a1a`, `#666666`, `#999999`

**Typography**:

- Sizes match mobile app specs

**Components**:
- Border radius: 12px-16px (cards), 8px (buttons/badges)
- Shadow: Subtle elevation
- Spacing: 20px padding, 24px sections

## Integration

Updated `src/app/(main)/page.jsx` to use `InteractiveFeaturesShowcase` instead of the static `PrimaryFeatures` component.

## Key Differences from Static Phone Mockup

**Before** (PrimaryFeatures):
- Static phone frame images
- Non-interactive placeholder content
- Limited engagement

**After** (InteractiveFeaturesShowcase):
- Fully interactive demos
- Real drag-and-drop swiping
- Click to expand/interact
- Closer representation of actual app

## Sample Data

All components use realistic sample data:
- Place images from Unsplash (restaurants, bars, activities)
- Realistic place names and descriptions
- Multiple mock users with initials and colors
- Various list scenarios (weekend brunch, date night, team building)

## Technologies Used

- **Framer Motion**: For drag gestures and animations
- **Headless UI**: For accessible tabs component
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with brand colors
- **Next.js**: Client components ('use client')

## Testing

✅ No linter errors
✅ All interactive features working
✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
✅ Smooth animations
✅ Matches brand guidelines

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add real place data from your database
2. Connect to actual app API for live demos
3. Add video recordings from real app as fallback
4. Create "Download App" CTA after interactions
5. Track user engagement with analytics
